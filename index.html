The last two Saturdays of February, saw the final activity of the academic year, 2020-2021, in the Primary School. The activity was named ‘Gifted’ as we feel our children, certainly are. They were asked to recite, sing, dance or play any musical instrument.All of them made us proud with their individual performance. The change from a shy youngster getting used to the online platform, to a supremely confident one, was heartwarming for the teachers and of course Ratna Ma’am and Sunitha Ma’am. Here we would like to mention our parents and thank them from the bottom of our hearts for being with us and supporting us right from the beginning of this difficult year.
